  when searching for something and certain search results are blocked just put for example:
CroxyProxy -> Blocked
Cr0xyPr0xy -> Not Blocked
  Just do that and if it asks for "Did you mean? (better result prob here)" just click yeah if u want and it wont get blocked.
  Use a VPN (preferably Cloudflare Warp or ProtonVPN)
  use browser extension vpns
  Use your phone hotspot or a different connection then the school or a pi-hole router or a router that blocks the schools/montioring software ips.

Tips:
If you resetted your pc then install everything back that orginially was on the device (if it was paid software then just use https://thepiratebay.org or some SAFE pirating place and a good torrent is [QBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) and always torrent over vpn) and make it look like if your device was never reset and log back in to everything, dont be unique, blend in. Also if your on windows 10 always clean up reguarly using [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/) and Disk Cleanup and [RevoUninstaller](https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo-uninstaller-free-download/). Also when you need to return your device (if you graduate or over the summer) reset the device and make it look normal again with everything installed on it. If they ask any questions about it being reset just say it was like that since you got it and always deny, but if it gets legal dont talk, ask for a lawyer. (highly doubt that they'll go this far) Don't get caught doing anything your not supposed to be doing and when your on the schools wifi use a VPN. (Cloudflare Warp or ProtonVPN prefered) Don't tell anyone or post that your pc is reset and dont be flexing and dont tie your schools life to your personal/social life, example: Logging into your socials on the unblocked device.

WARNING:
YOU CAN AND MAY GET Suspended, Expelled, Fined, or into legal trouble. IF YOU DO IT IS NOT ON ME PLEASE READ UP ON YOUR SCHOOLS POLICY WITH YOUR DEVICE.
